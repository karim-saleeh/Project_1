The company aims to develop a forecasting model to predict the electricity demand of new properties being constructed throughout the city. This model will enable accurate estimation of future electricity consumption, aiding in resource planning and infrastructure development. The process involves collecting historical data on electricity usage from existing properties and gathering information on upcoming construction projects. Relevant features such as property size, ID, Temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed and solar irradiance will be analysed to identify trends and correlations.

Various forecasting models, such as time series or machine learning algorithms, will be explored and trained using historical data. The trained model will then be used to forecast electricity demand for new properties based on their characteristics and expected completion dates. Continuous evaluation, adaptation, and improvement of the model will ensure its effectiveness in supporting decision-making for infrastructure development and resource allocation.

The availability of these diverse measurements, including temperature, humidity, precipitation, wind speed, and solar irradiance, provides valuable information for various analyses and applications. Researchers, climate scientists, and other stakeholders can utilize this dataset to study weather patterns, assess environmental impacts, develop predictive models, and evaluate the relationship between different factors.
It's important to note that this dataset represents a specific time period and should be used accordingly in analyses and forecasting models, considering the limitations and characteristics of the collected data during that timeframe.
